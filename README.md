# Workshop on Prompt Engineering, Langchain Basics, and Web Integration with Node.js

Welcome to the Workshop on Prompt Engineering, Langchain Basics, and Web Integration with Node.js! In this workshop, we will explore the concepts of prompt engineering, learn about the basics of Langchain, and understand how to integrate it into web applications using Node.js.

## Workshop Overview

In this workshop, we will cover the following topics:

1. Prompt Engineering: Understanding the importance of prompt engineering in natural language processing tasks and how it can improve model performance.
2. Langchain Basics: Exploring the fundamentals of Langchain, including its architecture, key components, and its role in language processing.
3. Web Integration with Node.js: Learning how to integrate Langchain into web applications using Node.js, allowing for real-time language processing on the web.
4. Hands-on Exercises: Engaging in practical exercises to apply the concepts learned throughout the workshop.
5. Q&A and Discussion: Providing an opportunity for participants to ask questions and engage in discussions.
